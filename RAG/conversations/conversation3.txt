Question: What was the result for TSM and why does it differ from MSC?

Model Response:  The result of the TSM uncertainty analysis for the LIMC system was approximately 22% uncertainty. This value is based on the equation (2) in the context provided, which sums up the uncertainties in the potentiometer, LED output, and photoresistor.

The MCS, however, produced different results every time due to its nature as a dynamic model capable of handling more complex systems. Although the difference between the two uncertainty analyses is small, it can be attributed to the complexities of each analysis method.

The TSM is considered a "static" analysis, which implies that the result will always be the same for an unchanging system and is simplistic yet reliable. In contrast, the MCS is a more complex analysis producing different results due to its iterative nature. The MCS can provide a better estimate of uncertainty for more complex systems where multiple variables interact.
